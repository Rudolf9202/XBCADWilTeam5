	NARA XBCAD Application
***************************************

Our NARA Application is about managing club bouncers and providing the bouncers with exact dates on when there shifts are where the working at that night.

During the Sprint 4 development process, the progress of us developing our NARA Application went as follows:
1.) We spoke about the page we have and what they do.
2.) We discussed what we want to do in our demo version.
3.) We broke it down to who is designing what pages in the demo version.
